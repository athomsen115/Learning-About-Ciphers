The ciphers used here are less ciphers and more steganography. 

Mary, Queen of Scotts, was beheaded in 1587 when a scrap of paper was decoded. Fifty-five years later, Charles the First, was saved by a piece of paper.

Examples in this folder include the null cipher, which is a steganographic technique for concealing plaintext within noncipher material. This can be difficult, so we can use a dictionary to identify words that fit the coded message and print those out in a string.

The Trevonian cipher was used to help Sir John escape from jail and execution. The message was sent to him, with each 3rd letter forming a secret message. The count is reset if a punctuation mark is encountered, and the plaintext message cannot contain punctuation.

The colchester program checks for a null cipher based on the nth letter at the start of every nth word.
